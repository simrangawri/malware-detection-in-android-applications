# Malware Detection for Android Applications

This project is aimed at detecting and classifying Android applications as either "Malware" or "Not Malware" using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

Malware detection is a crucial task in the field of cybersecurity. With the increasing use of Android devices, it's essential to identify and protect against malicious applications. This project uses various machine learning algorithms to analyze features of Android applications and predict whether they are malware or not.

## Getting Started

To use this malware detection system, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running:
   "pip install scikit-learn==1.0.1"

2. Prepare your dataset: The system expects a dataset in the form of an Excel file, which should contain various features of Android applications and a label column indicating whether each application is legitimate or malware.

3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook `malware_detection_final_code.ipynb` to train and test the machine learning models on your dataset.

4. You can also use the trained models for prediction by calling the `predict_malware()` function with the features of a new Android application.

## Machine Learning Models

This project includes the following machine learning models:

- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each model is trained and evaluated for its accuracy in detecting malware applications.

## Evaluation Metrics

The system uses various evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the models, including:

- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- Precision
- Recall
- Cohen's Kappa Score
- Brier Score Loss
- ROC AUC Score

These metrics provide insights into how well the models perform in detecting malware applications.

## Usage

To make predictions using the trained models, you can call the `predict_malware()` function with the features of an Android application. The function will return a label, indicating whether the application is "Malware" or "Not Malware."

Example usage:
```python
label = predict_malware(features)
print("Predicted label:", label)
